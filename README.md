# USA Regional Sales Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a USA regional sales dataset. The analysis notebook (`EDA_Regional_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`) reads the included Excel file `Regional Sales Dataset.xlsx`, performs cleaning, feature engineering, and creates charts for insights.

## Data Source
- The dataset used in this project is included as `Regional Sales Dataset.xlsx` in this repository.
- Author: Karan Pandre
- Data note: The dataset provided with this repo is the source used for analysis. Any external references used during the analysis are documented inline in the notebook where applicable.

## Files Included
- `EDA_Regional_Sales_Analysis.ipynb` — analysis notebook (outputs cleared where appropriate)
- `Regional Sales Dataset.xlsx` — source data used by the notebook
- `Sales_data(EDA Exported).csv` — exported cleaned dataset
- `Background/` — images used in visualizations or cover

## How to run locally
1. Install Python 3.8+ and dependencies: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, python-pptx (optional).
2. Open `EDA_Regional_Sales_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Ensure `Regional Sales Dataset.xlsx` is in the repo root (already included). Run the notebook cells.

## Notes
- Colab-specific mounting references were removed so the notebook runs locally from the included Excel file.

If you want, I can also create a minimal `requirements.txt` and clear notebook outputs before you push to GitHub.
