USA Regional Sales Analysis — Data Analyst (Python, Power BI)

Summary
Analyzed a 2014–2018 US regional sales dataset to perform end-to-end data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis; delivered a cleaned CSV for reporting, a reproducible Jupyter notebook, and an interactive Power BI dashboard to inform pricing and regional growth decisions.

Selected achievements
- Performed ETL on a multi-sheet Excel workbook (sales, customers, products, regions, budgets) using pandas; merged and cleaned records and exported a production-ready `Sales_data(EDA Exported).csv` used for reporting and BI.
- Engineered business metrics (profit, profit_margin_pct, monthly aggregates) and built time-series and geospatial visualizations that surfaced seasonal patterns (May–June peaks, January trough) and a notable 2017 anomaly for follow-up analysis.
- Identified key opportunities and concentrations: top products (e.g., Product 26 ≈ $118M) and top state (California ≈ $230M), and quantified channel mix (Wholesale ~54%), enabling targeted recommendations for margin and regional growth.
- Packaged analysis for stakeholders: reproducible Jupyter notebook (`EDA_Regional_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`) and Power BI file (`SALES REPORT.pbix`) to enable interactive exploration and executive reporting.
